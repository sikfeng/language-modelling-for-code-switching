# Multilingual BERT Models

The file containing the alternative sentences should be placed in `data/`. The models and logs will be saved to `models/`.

This directory contains the code to train models that use 1, 2, and 3 linear layers over the BERT [CLS] token, as well as using LayerNorm and ReLU.
