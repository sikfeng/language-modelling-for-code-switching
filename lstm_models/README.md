# LSTM Model

Most of the code here was adapted from [here](https://github.com/gonenhila/codeswitching-lm). The code provided by the authors contain some errors, so I have made a minimal patch file [here](https://gist.github.com/sikfeng/2afd994f037001fad3e97c4d164154ac).

The files containing the alternative sentences should be placed in `data/`. The models and logs will be saved to `models/`.
